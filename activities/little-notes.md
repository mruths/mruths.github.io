title: Little Notes
blurb: |
  These templates were inspired by aerograms that family in India used to send. Before there was internet or smartphones or video chat, Mitali would receive letters from relatives in India by air mail. They were written on thin paper folded into a letter in the shape of an envelope.

      You can download a template with designs to color or you can download a blank template to design your own little notes! Write or draw a message in the rectangle. Color or design your own flaps. Fold the triangles in to form an envelope shape. Close with a sealing sticker or bit of tape. Then share your note with someone this Diwali or any ordinary day. It’s always a nice time to let family and friends know you’re thinking about them.

      Before there was internet or smartphones or video chat, Mitali would receive letters from relatives in India by air mail. They were written on thin paper folded into a letter in the shape of an envelope. That way, it would cost less to send the letter, because you didn’t need a separate envelope.
